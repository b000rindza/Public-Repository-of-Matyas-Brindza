# Experimental Methods in Physics

The teacher advised against sharing the exact class materials, assignments and tests to prevent potential cheating. I found the subject very enjoyable and informative, so I'd like to highlight some of the projects without breaking my promise of adhering to the previous principle.

Homeworks :
	- Measuring the Earth's radius - measurement by the naked eye, empirical calculations
	- Using a Sundial - understanding the principles, reading time
	- Measuring the orbital height of satelites - measurements by the naked eye, empirical calculations
	- Statistical tasks related to proton-proton collisions
	- Statistical tasks related to cosmic muon detection
	- Fitting functions, understanding errors

In addition, we visited KFKI (Central Research Institute for Physics), where we had an interesting tour of a quantum optics lab.
