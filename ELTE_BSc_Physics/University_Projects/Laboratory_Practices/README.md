# Laboratory Practices

The main objective of laboratory practices was to help students grasp the essence of scientific measurements. We conducted 7-11 individual measurements per semester.


## Subjects

- Basic Physical Measurements (Fizikai alapmérések)
- Classical Physics Laboratory (Klasszikus fizika laboratórium)
- Modern Physics Laboratory (Modern fizika laboratórium)
- Modern Examination Methods in Physics (Korszerű vizsgálati módszerek a fizikában)




## Criteria for successfully completing a measurement

- Prepare for the preliminary test, which assessed our overall understanding of the measurement, including :
	- The physical properties of the (general) system we examined, as well as the related principles and formulae
	- The conclusions we aimed to reach based on collected data (and how to reach them)
	- The principles of operation of the relevant measurement equipment
	- (Potential) sources of error
- Conduct the measurement :
	- Follow safety regulations
	- Appropriately operate the equipment and gather data with the help of the assigned lab supervisor
- Submit the lab report, which includes :
	- The purpose of the measurement
	- The theoretical background
	- The experimental setup and its operation
	- The course of the measurement
	- Data processing and data visualization (mostly in Python)
	- Data analysis
	- Analysis of the sources of error (calculating the significant ones)
	- Conclusions




Notes about the lab reports :
- These are entirely in Hungarian.
- I mostly received a 4/5 or a 5/5 grade, so don't consider them as perfect.
- Some were entirely in an .ipynb notebook.
- Some of the Python code I wrote and some of the data files were lost due to an unfortunate device failure.
- Some were due instantly on local university software, which I cannot share (or even access).
- Some Python libraries were deprecated.
