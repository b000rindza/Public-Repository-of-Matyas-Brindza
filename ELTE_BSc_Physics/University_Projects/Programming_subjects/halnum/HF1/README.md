Implement the following functions :
- Bubble sort, return the number of swaps
- Find the smallest element, return the index as well
- Compute average and standard deviation
- Find an element in the vector, return the index as well
Extra : Quicksort


The arguments should be the following :
A : The name of the file that contains the vector. First test with vector.txt, then run with vector_verylong.txt.
B : The length of the vector. The length of vector is 12, the length of vector_verylong is 100000.
C : The program will check if C is inside the vector.



Compile :
gcc -o main main.c -lm

Run :
./main A B C

WARNING : vector_verylong might take 1 or 2 minutes.
