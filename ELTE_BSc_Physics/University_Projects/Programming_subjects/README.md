	- Numerical Methods in Physics I. **(Python)**

- 3rd semester : 
	- Advanced Numerical Methods **(C)**
 		- directory : **halnum**

- 4th semester : 
	- Numerical Methods in Physics II. **(Python)**
 		- directory : **fiznum2**
	- Modern Computational Methods in Phisics I. **(C++)**
 		- directory : **korszam**



Notes :
- You can find each homework assignment with its solution in the corresponding subdirectory.
- In each subdirectory 'README.md' provides additional information.
- The original versions were in Hungarian. Most of my code documentation is in Hungarian, some is in English.
